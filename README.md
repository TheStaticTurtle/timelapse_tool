# TimelapseTool

This is a very simple tool that I use to easily create timelapses of undifned lenght.
It uses a noraml usb camera as the input (In theory a 4k capture card should work but I'm not sure how python will react to it)

It's built to be very modular with a plugin system (for example the timelapse and real time monitor are separate plugins)

*DISCLAMER: This was litteraly built on the road during my vacation on a shitty laptop may contain bugs*

The tool itself is build arround OpenCV which allows for a multitude of different plugins to be made.
